# Test Driven Development with C# and .NET Core MVC [Video]
This is the code repository for [Test Driven Development with C# and .NET Core MVC [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/test-driven-development-c-and-net-core-mvc-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788391238), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Test-driven development (TDD) is a well-defined approach to creating software that is robust and maintainable. The principles of TDD will help you write better and cleaner code. In addition, you’ll see how having solid tests will give you a new sense of confidence when you need to modify existing code.

In this course, you will take the principles and tools of Test Driven Development and apply them to modern web development in .NET Core. Throughout the volume, you will build a single.NET Core MVC web app where each section will focus on a specific component of the MVC stack, providing detailed examples in a TDD environment. In the last section, you will learn how to implement Continuous Integration, where you will see the true value of TDD and how it can enable you to continually deliver high-quality applications at a faster rate than ever before.

By the end of the course, you will have the tools you need to start building bulletproof applications, backed by an automated suite of tests to ensure quality software delivery.
